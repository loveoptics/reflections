Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: Using a remote repository is useful for collaborating with other people.
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: You may be working on some change to the code that you have not yet pushed,
and not ready yet to receive the code in remote repository.
Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Branch is used to experiment on a local repository to experiment on substantially new code/concepts;
clone is used to copy a remote repository to your computer; fork is used to copy a repository on GitHub to
your GitHub account.
Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: To compare your recent commits using diff
